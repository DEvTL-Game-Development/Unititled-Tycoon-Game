## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the project, look inside one of the decks and choose something you want to work on.

Then, head to Discord server and discuss it with the others. We will assign the card an owner that says "Community".

Many cards also have a link within which will take you to a discord channel where you can discuss the task.

Important! Tasks are not permanently assigned to anyone. If somebody said they want to try a task, it is still possible for you to go and do it yourself. We will choose the solution which makes more sense to the project. Just make sure to synch with the others by going to the forum thread linked in cards.
