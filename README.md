# Unititled-Tycoon-Game
Project Description: An open-source tycoon game with focus on factories and transportation. The player can mine different ores in an infinite procedural generate voxel world. Later in the game he researches different technologies to transport the goods faster as in the early game. In the beginning he only has a steam engine and a conveyor belt, but in the late game he has very fast electrical engines. The game also will have a complex economy system so the can't bring all the goods just to one city. If you serve a city very well it will start to grow and will accept more goods. That's the planning for now. But you can suggest your own features and ideas. The chance that these will be accepted is not the smallest there is!
